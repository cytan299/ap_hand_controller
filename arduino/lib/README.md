# Arduino libraries that are required for the hand controller

This directory contains all the libraries that are necessary for
building *hand_controller.ino*. All these libraries have to be installed in

*~/Documents/Arduino/libraries*

on a Mac. For Linux or a PC, you will have to install it in the
correct place that the Arduino compiler requires.

### Libraries that are zip'ed

These libraries are needed to compile *hand_controller.ino* which I
have zipped here for convenience.

* **MenuSystem.zip** is from [Arduino Menu System Library](http://www.jonblack.me/arduino-menu-system-library/)
* **SFE_MicroOLED.zip** is from [Sparkfun Micro OLED Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Micro_OLED_Arduino_Library)

These files have to be unzipped and installed in

*~/Documents/Arduino/libraries*

on a Mac. For Linux or Windows, you will have to install it in the
correct place that the Arduino compiler requires.
