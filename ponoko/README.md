# Hand controller box and front cover

The hand controller box case and front cover are in this directory. Note that
the svg files are *not* empty! The lines are 0.01 mm thick that are
required for laser cutting by [Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com). To see
the designs, either zoom in or change the thickness of the lines with
a programme like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/).

* *ponoko_hc_box_v2.svg* contains enough parts for one hand controller box
and spacers for mounting the pcb into the box. If you use the _red
tint_ acrylic material for this part then you do not need to make a
red, transparent front cover. In my prototype, I had used acrylic
black for the body and
because it is not transparent, I had to make a separate front cover in
red tint. The specified material used for manufacture at [Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com) is
  * Acrylic red tint or black
  * 3.0 mm thick
  * P2 - 384.0 mm long x 384.0 mm wide
* *ponoko_cover.svg*  is _optional_. It contains the design for the front cover of the
  box.The material used must be red and transparent, i.e.
  * Acrylic red tint
  * 3 mm thick
  * P1 - 181.0 mm long x 181.0 mm wide
